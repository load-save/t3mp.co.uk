							  placeholder="Hey, my name is Temp! I'm a very competitive and creative individual who strives to compete with others and myself. My strengths have always been in Computers and IT, I specialize in Editing, Programming, Game Design, Graphic Design, and way more. My less technical hobbies consist of Making Music, Art, and Writing, along with my obsession with picking up new skills like learning the guitar or Japanese. I've been told I have somewhat of an Algorithmic mind, which makes sense as I love focusing on constantly bettering myself and mastering anything that seems fun to master, such as rapidly improving at games, and skills and building my knowledge on anything that interests me. I take pride in my work and I'm a massive perfectionist, I believe in quality over quantity always. Personality-wise, I'm chill and I like to adjust to my surroundings to fit in and be everyone's friend. I love anime and obviously, I love games; I play a lot of games competitively, however, I love Single-Player games, from Story-rich to Intensive gameplay. I hope you enjoy this, rather extra, description of myself (FBI Agents can thank me later).

Programming/Game Design: I've been building my knowledge of game design, ever since I opened Unity around 2017. The first language I learned was C Sharp obviously, then I got the hang of others such as Python and Javascript (loosely), so I could understand how programming works. This website is written with HTML, CSS, and JS. Additionally, I know VBS and AHK (and Scratch I guess), and currently learning CPP (combined with UE4) and Lua. 

Art/GFX/UX: Funnily enough, This website shows how I approach design: symbolistic, creative, unique, simplistic, and as extra as possible. This website isn't your average Carrd.co page that takes a couple of minutes to make. I would like to think this website resonates with my personality, and that the days spent making this was worth it. It takes a lot of effort to seem effortless. Although my art skills aren't shown to it's fullest potential here, I only draw for fun!

Editing/Filmmaking: Here's a fun fact, I've been making YouTube videos for almost a decade, and yet I don't have much to show for it. My old YouTube account got deleted, and I made a new one in 2019, since then I haven't had any time to focus on YouTube. In the meantime, however, I've edited for some YouTubers and have gotten a couple of editing commissions here and there. I would like to consider myself a really great editor, it's one of the few skills I can happily be proud and honest about. But obviously, no matter how good you are, there's always room for improvement. I've studied the art of films, by myself, and I know more about Cinematography than you might think. I'm a pretty knowledgeable Photographer and have filmed a handful of projects, and I'll continue to make more video-related stuff in the future.

Music/Writing: I think every person who says I love music is boring, I also think whoever can answer the question What's your favorite song/artist without rambling on, is boring. So instead, I'll just tell you I grew up with a creative and curious mind, which led me to cracking FL Studio and making the best music an eight-year-old possibly could, or so I thought. A few years down the line, my songs started to become decent, and I even learned how to sing, rap, and write lyrics. I included writing in this category as I value the way I approach lyric writing. I'm very into symbolism and metaphors, and writing lyrics is rather therapeutic as you can express so much with words. But also writing stories and poems is fun too.

Before I sign off, I wanted to say thank you for stopping by my silly little website. As of writing this, My current dream is to become a Youtuber, Release multiple games, and have at least one of my songs get noticed, then I can die peacefully knowing I left my mark on the Internet.
